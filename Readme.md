# How to display disabled buttons for particular cells within a ButtonEdit column


<p>This example demonstrates how to display a disabled button for particular cellsÂ depending upon some condition. This task can be accomplished by creating a custom button editor. Please refer to theÂ <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/4716/controls-and-libraries/editors-and-simple-controls/common-editor-features-and-concepts/custom-editors">Custom Editors</a>Â article to learn more about custom editor creation.</p>
<p>The described solution is based on overridingÂ the OnBeginPaint() method of a custom ViewInfo class. This method is called before drawing the editor and applies a desiredÂ button state dependingÂ upon theÂ condition. Additionally, the RepositoryItemCustomButtonEdit.GetButtonState event is implemented. Subscribing to this event allows a customer toÂ pass any custom condition to the editor. TheÂ GetButtonState event handler hasÂ the ButtonStateEventArgs parameter, which contains a GridCellInfo class instance as the Tag property. Necessary GridControl data can be obtained from the Tag object.</p>
